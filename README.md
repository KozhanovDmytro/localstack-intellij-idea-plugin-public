## Description
The LocalStack plugin for IntelliJ IDEA is designed exclusively for IntelliJ IDEA users, enabling them to create and 
manage resources in LocalStack directly from their IDE. This plugin supports several AWS services like SQS, S3, SNS, 
and Lambda, with ongoing development to introduce more services in the future. 

Given our small development team, we are unable to add a large number of services quickly. If you find this project 
helpful, please consider supporting us by purchasing a subscription or making a [donation](#donations). The plugin operates on a 
freemium model, offering both free and paid features.

<img alt="img.png" height="100" src="./images/troubleshoot/dns_resolving.png"/>

That's an issue on the LocalStack, to solve this please add the following DNS rules
to hostname mapping file: 
```
127.0.0.1 sqs.eu-central-1.localhost.localstack.cloud
